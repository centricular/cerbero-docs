# Introduction to Cerbero

Cerbero is a Python-based packaging system for downloading, compiling, installing, and packaging GStreamer and all the libraries it uses. Instructions on how to do this for each component are codified in `recipe` files which are shipped with Cerbero itself. Cerbero can be used on Linux, OS X, and Windows, and can cross-compile for Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS. See the full [list of architectures and platforms](#supported-platforms).
